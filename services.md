## Services Idea

Need to break up each service so it's contained within it's own file. The name of the file will be the same name as the service. E.g.

Customers -> customers.js
Refunds -> refunds.js

Each service will be located inside of the services directory.

## API Setup

1. User calls init with their setup details
2. Then they can call any of the API util methods and the other details are referenced
